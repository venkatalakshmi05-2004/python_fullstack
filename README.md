Api-Application Programming Interface->Stands between frontend and backend
Middleware - stands as security check for request and response
Authorization vs Authentication
authentication tells who are you eg: normal login
authorization tells what you can able to do eg:staff and students
react- web framework for frontend development in javascript
flask,fastapi,django- web framework for backend development in python

# SQL Basics
dbms-->database management system
rdbms-relational database management system
## constraints
--> Primary key eg:Student_ID
-->Foreign key eg:Department_ID
-->Unique Key eg:Email_ID
-->Not null eg:Name
-->Default value eg:status default 'Pending'
-->Check constraint eg:Age > 18
-->Auto increment eg:ID auto increment

## DDL 
create

rollback
savepoint

## DQL
SELECT

## CRUD
create-->insert
retrieve-->select
update-->update
delete-->delete

## SQL Commands
select * from table_name;
select one_column from table_name;
select one,two_column from table_name;

## filtering
select column_name from table_name where condition;
 eg:select * from customers where country='USA';
## logical operators
and
or
not

## comparison operators
==
!=
>
<
>=
<=

## in,not in,between
select column_name from table_name where column_name in (value1,value2,value3);


## like 
select column_name from table_name where column_name like '%a_'

## distinct
display unique values
select distinct column_name from table_name;

## order by
select column_name from table_name order by column_name asc/desc;

## aggregate functions
avg()-->average
sum()-->sum of values
count()-->count of values
min()-->minimum value
max()-->maximum value

## filtering after aggregrate function
having
select min(column_name) from table_name group by column_name having min(column_name) > 10;

## joins
left join
right join
inner join
full outer join
cross join-cartesian product of two tables

select d.department_name,e.employee_name from employees e inner join departments d on e.department_id = d.department_id;

# steps for flask full stack development
'''
1.create repo from github
(in local system)
2.git clone <repo_url>
3.".gitignore file will remove unwanted files, mandatory gitignore entries are env,*.pyc,.env"
4.python3 -m venv env
5. . env/bin/activate
6.pip install flask
7.pip freeze > requirements.txt
8.pip install -r requirements.txt

9.create templates(for all html pages) and static(for css,js,images,audio,video,other files etc) folders
10.create routes and render templates in app.py
11.create api endpoints in app.py
12.end points are follows
/login--> login page
/register --> register page
13.while register user details will store in db(which is sqlite3 in future it can be changed to mysql)
14.logout --> logout redirect to login page
15./api/register--> for checking duplicate user_email before registration process and if user_email is not duplicate then it will store user details in db
16./api/login--> for checking user_email and password and if user_email and password are correct then it will return home page parallely manage sessions (means login status of user in db)and if user_email and password are incorrect then it will return error message
17./logout --> for logging out user and removing session

18.python3 app.py
